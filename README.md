# Google Cloud Storage Integration for Flutter Apps

I have multiple assets, such as CSV, JSON, images, videos, etc., that need to be stored in Google Cloud Storage. The main operations for this package are as follows:

1.Restricted Access: All buckets require proper permissions for access.
2.Shared Buckets: Access to shared buckets across multiple apps can be configured based on the settings in assets/env/.env.production.
3.Private Buckets: Access to private buckets specific to each app can be configured using the settings in assets/env/.env.production.
4.User-Specific Directories: Access to directories within the app's private buckets, specifically linked to the user ID (UID), can be managed based on assets/env/.env.production settings.
5.CRUD Operations: The package supports Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on the contents of the appâ€™s private storage bucket.

This package is designed to work with Flutter apps and allows efficient and scalable asset storage and management for multiple applications.

How to Implement
To implement this for your Flutter app, follow these steps:

1.Ensure you have set up the .env.production file with the correct environment configurations.
2.Use this package to manage access and operations for Google Cloud Storage within your Flutter app.
3.Customize and extend the storage functionality as needed for shared or private app storage.

This solution provides a robust way to handle cloud storage operations across multiple apps, each with its own shared or private storage needs.

This description highlights the functionality and structure of your storage operations in a clear and concise way for pub.dev users.
